### 1. What is Region & Availability Zones ?
AWS has the concept of a Region, which is a physical location around the world where they cluster data centers.

They call each group of logical data centers an Availability Zone
Each AWS region consists of multiple, isolated, and physically seperate AZs within a geographic area.

TIP: Edge location > Availability Zones > Regions

### 2. What is Edge Locations
An Edge Location is where end-users access services located at AWS, the cloud computing division of US-Headquartered Amazon. They are located in most of the major cities around the world and are specifically used by CloudFront(CDN) to distribute content to end-users to reduce latency.
